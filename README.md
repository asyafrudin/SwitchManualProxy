# SwitchManualProxy
This is just a batch file for people who needs to repeatedly switch between Proxy ON and Proxy OFF in their Windows. It will **only** turn ON/OFF the option to manually use a proxy server. That's it.

# Instructions
Download the batch file, double-click it or run it however you want, and off you go ... with less clicking through your computer settings. :grinning:	

**WARNING**: This batch file tweaks with your registry. Proceed with caution!
